# Library-System
Many libraries have a library system:
- Helps add books and search for them  
- Maintains information about the borrowed books

This is a simple version of this classical system.

### Main User: Admin
- Might add a book, user, or perform some relevant operation  
- **No need for login/logout functionalities** in this console system

### System Flow
- The system starts with a menu
  - It shows all possible choices
  - The admin selects a choice
    - Some operation is performed
  - Then the main menu is listed again
